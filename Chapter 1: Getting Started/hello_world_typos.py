# Try It Yourself 1-2: Hello World Typos
# Asks us to generate typos on the hello_world.py file
# Can you make a typo that generates an error?
#   Yes, you can. I misspelled "print".
# Can you make sense of the error message?
#   Yes, I could. By changing the word "print" to "pritn", you're giving
#   the wrong command to the program. Therefore, it won't run.
# Can you make a typo that doesn’t generate an error?
#   Yes, you can. I misspelled "Hello".
# Why do you think it didn’t make an error?
#   The word "Hello" isn't a command to the program, it's something for
#   us to see. Python doesn't mind it's misspelled because it's not a command.
